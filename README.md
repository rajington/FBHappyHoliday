# FB Happy Holiday

Appears as a context menu when you right-click the text areas on https://www.facebook.com/events/birthdays

Extension is very tied to current DOM hierarchy so if anything doesn't work file a bug, might need to switch to a better method.

Prefixes "Happy" and adds the friend's first name.

Holidays come from https://www.checkiday.com
